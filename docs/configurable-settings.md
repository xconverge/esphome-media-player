# Settings

All of these are available from the device page in Home Assistant (**Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** → your device). No YAML or reflashing needed.

## Media player selection

After first boot, the display shows **"Set media player in device settings"** until a player is set:

1. Open your device under **ESPHome**.
2. Under **Configuration**, find the **Media Player** field.
3. Enter the entity ID (e.g. `media_player.living_room`).

The device updates immediately and keeps your choice across reboots. You can change it anytime. See [How do I configure a media player?](/troubleshooting#how-do-i-configure-a-media-player) if you need more detail.

### TV source (optional)

If your speaker has a "TV" source (e.g. a home theater setup), you can optionally configure a secondary media player so the controller shows now-playing info from the TV device when the speaker switches to the TV input. Most users can ignore this setting.

1. Under **Configuration**, find the **Sonos Tv Source** field.
2. Enter the entity ID of the media player that represents the TV source device (e.g. `media_player.apple_tv`).

Leave the field empty if your speaker doesn't have a TV source or you don't want this feature — the controller works normally without it. The device reboots when this value is changed (the same as changing the primary media player). See [TV source mode](/features#tv-source-mode-optional) for how the feature works.

## Backlight and screensaver

These are under the device's **Configuration** section. Values persist across reboots. Brightness adjusts automatically between day and night based on the `sun.sun` entity in Home Assistant.

::: info
The 10.1" panel has a side-panel layout where track info is always visible, so the Track Info Duration setting only applies to the 4" panel.
