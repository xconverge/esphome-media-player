# Screen Saver

When playback is paused, the device uses a two-stage screen saver to reduce power consumption and prevent burn-in. All settings are configurable from the device page in Home Assistant (**Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** → your device).

## How it works

1. **Dimming** — After **Screen Saver: Paused Dimming** elapses (default: 60 s), the screen dims to the **Day/Night: Dim Brightness** level.
2. **Screen saver** — After **Screen Saver: Timer** elapses (default: 300 s), the screen saver activates:
   - If **Screen Saver: Clock** is enabled, a large `HH:MM` clock is shown at **Screen Saver: Clock Brightness**.
   - If **Screen Saver: Clock** is disabled and the **Day/Night: Screen Saver** switch is on, the screen turns off completely.
   - If both are disabled, the screen stays at dim brightness indefinitely.

Any touch or new media playback instantly returns the display to full active brightness.

## Clock screen saver

An optional clock screen saver displays the current time in large, thin digits on a black background. When enabled, it replaces the screen-off stage — the display is never fully dark.

The clock position drifts subtly each minute across a small region to prevent burn-in. Brightness is controlled independently via **Screen Saver: Clock Brightness** (default: 35%).

## Day/Night awareness

Brightness levels and screen saver behavior adapt automatically based on the `sun.sun` entity in Home Assistant:

- **Daytime** (sun above horizon) — uses **Day: Active Brightness**, **Day: Dim Brightness**, and the **Day: Screen Saver** switch.
- **Nighttime** (sun below horizon) — uses **Night: Active Brightness**, **Night: Dim Brightness**, and the **Night: Screen Saver** switch.

This lets you configure different behavior for day and night — for example, keeping the screen on during the day but turning it off at night.
