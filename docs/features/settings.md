# Settings

Most settings are configurable from the device's built-in web settings page — no YAML or reflashing needed. See [Web Settings](/features/webserver) for how to open it, or go to the device in Home Assistant under **Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** and click **Visit**.

The web settings page runs on the device's ESPHome web server on port `80`. It uses the project's hosted web UI bundle, so the device needs internet access the first time the browser loads the page. On the 4" ESP32-S3 display, opening the web settings page also shows a **Web settings active** screen on the device while the browser is connected.

Some configuration entities may also appear on the Home Assistant device page, depending on the device model, but the web settings page is the main place to configure current firmware.

## Media Player

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Media Player** | The primary `media_player` entity to control, for example `media_player.living_room_speaker`. Saving a valid entity may reboot the device so the Home Assistant subscription is refreshed. |

## Advanced

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Linked Media Player** | Optional secondary `media_player` entity used when the main speaker switches to a TV or Line-in source. Leave empty to disable. Saving a valid entity may reboot the device so the Home Assistant subscription is refreshed. |

## Playback

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Track Clock** | On shows time remaining; off shows the track length. Tap the time label on the device to toggle this at any time. |
| **Show Progress Bar** | Shows or hides the playback progress bar. |
| **Auto-Show Track Info** | Shows track title and artist automatically when new playback information arrives. Turn this off to keep square screens focused on artwork and the progress bar; tap the screen to show or hide the info manually. Shown on the ESP32-S3 4848S040 and ESP32-P4 86 Panel. |
| **Track Info Duration** | How long track info stays visible after artwork loads or playback starts. Choose **Always** to keep track info visible and never auto-hide it. Options: Always, 3 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, or 1 minute. Shown on the ESP32-S3 4848S040 and ESP32-P4 86 Panel. |

## Idle Screen

## Clock

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Clock Format** | Display the clock screen saver in 24-hour or 12-hour format. The 12-hour format omits AM/PM so the large clock still fits and can drift for burn-in prevention. Defaults to 24-hour. |
| **Timezone** | IANA-style timezone for the clock and scheduled screen-off controls. The browser shows the current GMT offset. Defaults to UTC. |

## Day/Night

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Day/Night Source** | Optional `binary_sensor` or `input_boolean` entity to control day/night mode (`on` = day, `off` = night). Leave empty to use `sun.sun` (default). See [Screen Saver](/features/screen-saver#custom-day-night-sensor). |

## Screen Brightness

## Screen Tone <Badge type="info" text="ESP32-P4 only" />

Shifts album art toward warmer colors for a more comfortable viewing experience, especially at night. Separate day and night sliders follow the same [day/night detection](/features/screen-saver#day-night-awareness) used by screen brightness. The tint updates instantly without reloading the image.

| **Install Update** | Installs the checked update when one is available. |
| **Auto Update** | When enabled, firmware updates are installed automatically when detected. Default: on. |
