# Manual Setup

Install the media player firmware via the ESPHome dashboard instead of the web installer. This gives you full control over substitutions and lets you customise behaviour that the web installer leaves at defaults.

## Prerequisites

- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) running (as a Home Assistant add-on or standalone)
- Your device connected via USB for the first flash (OTA updates work after that)

## Create a configuration

In the ESPHome dashboard, create a new YAML configuration for your device. Use one of the examples below as a starting point.

### ESP32-S3 4848S040 (4")

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: "music-dashboard"
  friendly_name: "Music Dashboard"
  # ha_host: "homeassistant.local"  # Home Assistant hostname (change if HA runs on a different host)
  # ha_port: "8123"  # Home Assistant port (change if HA runs on a non-standard port)

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

packages:
  music_dashboard:
    url: https://github.com/jtenniswood/esphome-media-player
    files: [guition-esp32-s3-4848s040/packages.yaml]
    ref: main
    refresh: 1s
```

### ESP32-P4 JC8012P4A1 (10.1")

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: "music-dashboard-10inch"
  friendly_name: "Music Dashboard 10inch"
  # ha_host: "homeassistant.local"  # Home Assistant hostname (change if HA runs on a different host)
  # ha_port: "8123"  # Home Assistant port (change if HA runs on a non-standard port)

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

packages:
  music_dashboard:
    url: https://github.com/jtenniswood/esphome-media-player
    files: [guition-esp32-p4-jc8012p4a1/packages.yaml]
    ref: main
    refresh: 1s
```

## Available substitutions

These substitutions can be added to the `substitutions:` block in your configuration to override the defaults.

| Substitution      | Default                 | Description                                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`            | —                       | Device name used on your network (required)                                |
| `friendly_name`   | —                       | Display name shown in Home Assistant (required)                            |
| `media_player`    | `""`                    | Entity ID of your primary media player (configured in HA after first boot) |
| `tv_media_player` | `""`                    | Entity ID of a secondary TV media player (optional)                        |
| `ha_host`         | `"homeassistant.local"` | Hostname or IP address of Home Assistant                                   |
| `ha_port`         | `"8123"`                | Port that Home Assistant is running on                                     |

The ESP32-S3 4848S040 also supports rotation substitutions (`display_rotation`, `touch_mirror_x`, `touch_mirror_y`) — see the comments in `packages.yaml` for values.

## Non-standard Home Assistant host or port

By default the device constructs artwork URLs using `homeassistant.local` on port `8123`. If your Home Assistant instance uses a different hostname/IP or runs on a different port (for example behind a reverse proxy on port `80`), album art will fail to load.

To fix this, uncomment and change the `ha_host` and/or `ha_port` substitutions in your configuration:

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: "music-dashboard"
  friendly_name: "Music Dashboard"
  ha_host: "192.168.1.100"
  ha_port: "80"
```

The device builds artwork URLs as `http://<ha_host>:<ha_port>/api/...`, so both the host and port must match whatever Home Assistant is reachable on from the device's network.

::: tip
Users who installed via the web installer do not need these settings — they default to `homeassistant.local` and `8123`. If you need to change the host or port after a web install, adopt the device into your ESPHome dashboard and add the `ha_host` and/or `ha_port` substitutions to the generated configuration.
