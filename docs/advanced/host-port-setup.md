# Host/Port Setup

By default the device constructs artwork URLs using `http://homeassistant.local:8123`. If your Home Assistant instance uses HTTPS, a different hostname/IP, or a non-standard port, album art will fail to load.

To fix this, add the relevant substitutions to your configuration:

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: "music-dashboard"
  friendly_name: "Music Dashboard"
  ha_protocol: "https"
  ha_host: "192.168.1.100"
  ha_port: "8123"
  ha_verify_ssl: "false"  # set to "false" for self-signed or local CA certs
```

The device builds artwork URLs as `<ha_protocol>://<ha_host>:<ha_port>/api/...`, so the protocol, host, and port must all match whatever Home Assistant is reachable on from the device's network.

## HTTPS (SSL) configuration

If Home Assistant is served over HTTPS (for example via the [Let's Encrypt add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/ssl_tls/) with SSL on port 8123, or behind a reverse proxy), artwork requests will fail unless you tell the device to use HTTPS.

1. **Set the protocol** — Add `ha_protocol: "https"` so artwork URLs use `https://` instead of `http://`.

2. **Use a hostname for HTTPS** — For HTTPS the device uses the configured `ha_host` (it does not switch to the API client IP). The hostname must match the hostname on your SSL certificate (e.g. `homeassistant.local` or your FQDN). Using a raw IP with HTTPS will cause certificate mismatch errors.

3. **Self-signed or local CA certificates** — If your certificate is self-signed or signed by a local CA that the device doesn't trust, set `ha_verify_ssl: "false"` so the HTTP client skips certificate verification. Only do this on a trusted local network.

**Example: HTTPS with Let's Encrypt (trusted cert)**

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: "music-dashboard"
  friendly_name: "Music Dashboard"
  ha_protocol: "https"
  ha_host: "homeassistant.local"   # or your FQDN — must match cert
  ha_port: "8123"
  # ha_verify_ssl defaults to "true"; no need to set it for public CAs
```

**Example: HTTPS with self-signed or local CA cert**

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: "music-dashboard"
  friendly_name: "Music Dashboard"
  ha_protocol: "https"
  ha_host: "homeassistant.local"
  ha_port: "8123"
  ha_verify_ssl: "false"   # required for self-signed or local CA
```

Default behaviour remains `http` on port `8123` with SSL verification enabled, so existing setups are unchanged.
