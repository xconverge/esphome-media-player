- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) with at least one `media_player` entity

## Connect to Wi-Fi

After flashing, the device creates a Wi-Fi hotspot called **esphome-media-player**. Connect to it from your phone or laptop and enter your home Wi-Fi credentials. The device will reboot and join your network.

## Add to Home Assistant

1. Home Assistant should automatically discover the device under **Settings → Devices & Services**. Click **Configure** to add it.

3. Open the device page and set the **Media Player Entity** field to the `media_player` entity you want to control (e.g. `media_player.living_room_speaker`).
