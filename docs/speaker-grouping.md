# Speaker Grouping

Control multi-room speaker groups directly from the touchscreen panel. The settings panel (swipe down) shows a speaker list on the right side where you can add or remove speakers from the group and adjust individual volumes.

Speaker grouping requires speakers that support the `media_player.join` and `media_player.unjoin` services in Home Assistant.

## How it works

- The panel auto-discovers all speakers from the configured integration in your Home Assistant instance
- The currently selected speaker is shown first
- The main volume adjusts all grouped speakers proportionally, keeping their relative balance
- Per-speaker `−` / `+` buttons let you fine-tune individual volumes within the group
- The toggle states update automatically when the group changes

## Compatibility

This feature relies on Home Assistant's `media_player.join` and `media_player.unjoin` services. These are only available on speaker platforms that support grouping. If your speakers don't support these services, the grouping controls will not work.

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Sonos | Yes | Tested and confirmed |
| Google Cast | Yes | Supports `join` / `unjoin` |
| HEOS (Denon/Marantz) | Yes | Supports `join` / `unjoin` |
| Yamaha MusicCast | Yes | Supports `join` / `unjoin` |
| LinkPlay | Yes | Supports `join` / `unjoin` |
| Bluesound | Yes | Supports `join` / `unjoin` |
| Bang & Olufsen | Yes | Supports `join` / `unjoin` |

## Setup

One template sensor helper needs to be created in Home Assistant. This is done entirely through the UI — no YAML editing required. 

### Create the Speaker Group sensor

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers** tab
2. Click **+ Create Helper** → **Template** → **Template a sensor**
3. Fill in the following:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | `Speaker Group` |
| State template | see below |

Paste this into the **State template** field, replacing `"sonos"` with the name of your speaker integration (e.g. `"cast"`, `"heos"`, `"yamaha_musiccast"`):

```
{%- set s = integration_entities("sonos") | select("match", "media_player") | list -%}
{{ s | map("replace", "media_player.", "") | join(",") }}|{{ s | map("state_attr", "friendly_name") | join(",") }}|{{ s | map("state_attr", "volume_level") | join(",") }}
```

Leave all other fields as default and click **Submit**.

### Verify

Go to **Developer Tools → States** and search for `sensor.speaker_group`. It should show a pipe-delimited string containing short entity IDs (without the `media_player.` prefix), friendly names, and volume levels, e.g.:

```
office,kitchen|Office,Kitchen|0.45,0.6
```

The ESPHome panel subscribes to this sensor automatically at boot. If the speaker page is empty, reboot the screen to see the update.

::: warning Upgrading from an earlier version?
If you previously created a sensor named `Sonos Speakers` (`sensor.sonos_speakers`), you'll need to delete it and create a new one named `Speaker Group` (`sensor.speaker_group`), or rename the existing helper.
:::

## Behavior

- The speaker list appears in the settings panel (swipe down) when there are at least two speakers from the configured integration
- Up to 8 speakers are supported

## State template reference

If you prefer YAML over the UI, you can add this to your `configuration.yaml` or a `packages/` file. Replace `"sonos"` with your integration name:

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Speaker Group"
        unique_id: esphome_speaker_group
        state: >-
          {%- set s = integration_entities("sonos")
                      | select("match", "media_player")
                      | list -%}
          {{ s | map("replace", "media_player.", "") | join(",") }}|{{ s | map("state_attr", "friendly_name") | join(",") }}|{{ s | map("state_attr", "volume_level") | join(",") }}
```
